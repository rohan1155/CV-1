                <br>
                <p> it is often confusing to new developers why there are so many ways to express the same thing on a rendered website. <strong>b and strong </strong>are perhaps one of the most common sources of confusion, causing developers to ask "Should I use b or strong? Don't they both do the same thing?"
            
                    Not exactly. The strong element is for content that is of greater importance, while the b element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
                    
                    It may help to realize that both are valid and semantic elements in HTML and that it's a coincidence that they both have the same default styling (boldface) in most browsers (although some older browsers actually underline strong). Each element is meant to be used in certain types of scenarios, and if you want to bold text for decoration, you should instead actually use the CSS font-weight property.
                    
                    The intended meaning or purpose of the enclosed text should be what determines which element you use. Communicating meaning is what semantics are all about.</p>
